### Story 
You wake up as a rat in the walls of the Hazelwood Chateau with a sinking realization that it's the evening of Ratsgiving. Your lovely rat family and rat friends are all waiting in the attic for you to show up. Navigate through the halls of the Hazelwood Chateau, avoiding dangers such as the family cats, Mochi and Matcha; the housekeeping staff; and family members. 

Along the way, you may meet more friends to bring to the table with you and might even find some more food to bring as a Ratsgiving dish. 

We hope to see you at the table! üêÄ
